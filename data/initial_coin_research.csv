81,ArchCoin,ARCH,"The original ARCH whitepaper focused on the concept of controlling the flow of information within a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC) in an effort to promote financial stability and growth within a DAC and protecting sensible information. While most cryptocurrencies are created as an alternative to bitcoin, ARCH was created as a startup holding DAC whose equity is represented by a cryptographic token. The goal is to test new applications of blockchain technology as well as to model an investor-token relationship in a use-case scenario involving a real startup with palpable products and services. To improve equity fungibility, revenue from any of the holding company&#39;s products or services is to be used to purchase more tokens from the market, thereby making the holding DAC&#39;s equity token exponentially more valuable with each additional revenue stream. Although no substantial revenue has been injected into ARCH&#39;s fungibility yet, its tiered conditional access levels have created a natural self-audit system that has proven very effective when it comes to managing this pseudo-corporate setup and its investors. Value in information is trusted to investors according to their own responsibility in the pseudo-corporate structure. In this tiered setup, the amount of tokens held serves as a basis of evaluating trust and involvement with the DAC itself. This system promotes unbiased transparency by the developers and corporate responsibility on behalf of the investors. This system alone, without any major revenue stream, has already proven itself as the backbone of the current stable growth in the ARCH equity token&#39;s market cap.This unique approach opens doors for a new generation of DACs, fusing decentralized communities with traditional corporate structures using tiered conditional access levels to secure the flow of information. Although tailored to our specific ventures and “community” needs, the ARCH wallet concept is an outstanding, first-of-its-kind example for other future DACs looking to combine all relevant information and tools regarding the DAC&#39;s and its equity token in one place. ARCH is taking that concept even further and seeks to integrate the whole corporate structure into its wallet as the DAC grows. In a nutshell, Arch rearranged how investors interacted in DACs to establish healthier lines of communication while changing the financial structure so that FIAT revenue would be injected directly into the tokens fungibility instead of being distributed through dividends.Their products, services and software are inspired by bitcoin, disruptive and innovative but not interdependent.",16403135,Scrypt,PoS,22/10/2014,0.0,"Cryptsy, Poloniex, BTER, BitTrex"

The first purpose is to act as a measurement of “virtual stake” regarding revenue produced by the GeoFounders software catalogue. GUNS tokens are analyzed using a simple formula due to the fixed nature of the GUNS supply. For every GUNS token a person possesses, they receive 0.0000009% of the revenue generated by the GeoFounders software collective. The more tokens you possess, the greater your share of the revenue.The second purpose of GUNS tokens are to act as a verification mechanism within different GeFounder applications. Depending on the software, this authentication process can provide different services. For example, the primary GeoFounder members application uses token verification to allow communication within the software while other applications provide novelty software rights, such as the ability to name an in-game location within GeoRealms if you can verify an account with 1000 or more GUNS.",100000000,,,20/06/2017,100000000.0,EtherDelta

The trading yields aren&#39;t guaranteed biweekly as there may be an occurrence where there is a net loss during the timeframe.

The way to make money directly through Bitcoin is to predict its future price. WCG has an innovative mechanism to allow the transaction fees to be recycled, that is, all of the transaction fees included in that block of the forging account be rewarded. For the time being, there are only three ways to generate transaction fees: arbitrary messages, WCG transfers and aliases. But as WCG adds more features, each of the WCG accounts that are forged will continue to increase. As WCG has a practical mechanism to get more new features through its voting system, it is hoped that the community would agree to add more promising new features, to correspond to the increase of transaction fees and WCG&#39;s real interest rate. By combining all these features with a scalable framework, WCG has become the foundation of a well-established and mature peer-to-peer economy.

Xaurum is ment to be used as a store of value since the gold base that backs Xaurum is always growing.The former cryptocurrency, Xaurum (XAU) had an ICO period, in which 1016 XAU coins were sold. In the RICO period, these XAU coins are exchangeable for XAUR at a 1-8000 rate. During this RICO period, anyone was also allowed to send cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to the Auresco Institute to recieve newly created XAUR. In this smart contract system, the old PoS XAU coins that were swapped and the ones that were minted in the RICO period will be in circulation (all of these coins have been backed by gold), and the remaining supply is locked (the locked supply is not backed by gold). Xaurum users have two ways of acquiring tokens, you can earn them in the ""Goldmine"" or Mint them. When mining on the Goldmine, users are exchanging their hashpower in a multipool. The earned coins from staking and mining these cryptocurrencies is used to buy more gold and to release Xaurum that was previously locked into circulation, by backing it with the newly bought gold. The proceeds from the Multipool can also be used to buy Xaurum in an exchange and pay the miners, depending on the market value of Xaurum, mined cryptocurrencies and the gold itself. when Minting new coins, users are allowed to send fiat currencies directly to the Auresco Institute in exchange for new coins. These users are called Masternodes but they do not mantain the blockchain. Instead, they are required to have a 1000 XAUR collateral (like Dash masternodes), in order to create new coins. This ensures that any fraud attempt would not be profitable for the Xaurum masternodes.Profits from running the PoW multipool and from the Minting process are sent to the Commonwealth wallet, and allow the Xaurum system to increase their gold supply at a must faster pace than the XAUR supply itself.",127108472.4829,,,18/08/2016,127105651.98296924,"Novaexchange, CCEX, HitBTC, BitTrex, LiveCoin, EtherDelta"

The Cosmos Hub is a multi-asset proof-of-stake cryptocurrency with a simple governance mechanism which enables the network to adapt and upgrade. In addition, the Cosmos Hub can be extended by connecting other zones. The hub and zones of the Cosmos network communicate with each other via an inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, a kind of virtual UDP or TCP for blockchains. Tokens can be transferred from one zone to another securely and quickly without the need for exchange liquidity between zones. Instead, all inter-zone token transfers go through the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the total amount of tokens held by each zone. The hub isolates each zone from the failure of other zones. Because anyone can connect a new zone to the Cosmos Hub, zones allow for future-compatibility with new blockchain innovations.",,PoS,,01/01/0001,,

Any user can therefore audit the profits generated by the company in real time. Since the blockchain ensures full transparency, unlike conventional banking systems, stakeholders and shareholders will be able to ensure they are not being cheated. This will also add a novel dimension to share trading as it will allow for real time disclosure of Company revenues.The Obits buyback program will occur at regular intervals, just like government bond auctions, with the first in February 2016. The idea is that out of the 18,276,898 issued at launch the profits will then be used to reduce the number of coins in supply - like a traditional stock buyback if the number of shares is reduced then the value of each share will be increase. The opposite could be true too with dilution taking place if the network of Companies involved decides to add other Companies to its network and justify it with the addition of further OBITS. As it is a essentially a stock crossed with an affiliate agreement depending on the future profits of a group of companies - there is high levels of risk involved.

Anyone can mine effectively, with minimal resource consumption and nuisance. – With the influx of ASICs we thought decentralized mining will soon be dead, with GroestlCoin it is reborn and taken to another level.- The extra added value of Groestl is that the “richer advantage” (owning several GPU) is less interesting with Groestl; so fairer.- Stands for democratization of currency and mining, the ability to send and receive money immediately anywhere in the world, to not pay expensive banking fees, and to transact in an environment that is secure and anonymous.- Through an innovative algorithm, the Groestlcoin network consumes far less energy, maintains stronger security, and rewards miners in more sustainable ways than sha256, scrypt, x11 and x13 based coins. – Grostl will be the new greener home of GPU miners as it offers greater hashing results with less energy and heat.- They strive to make groestlcoin available to the masses. Innovative and user friendly, accessible for everyone. They highly value integrity and transparency. Digital currencies are the future and Groestlcoin will be one of the leaders in this revolution.The name ""Grøstl"" is a multilingual play-on-words, referring to an Austrian dish usually made of leftover potatoes and pork, cut into slices. These are roasted on a pan together with onions and butterfat. The dish is often seasoned with salt, pepper, marjoram, cumin, and parsley, and served with a fried egg or kraut (cabbage). Hence, gröstl is somewhat similar to the American dish called hash. The letter ‘ö’ was replaced by ‘ø’, which is a letter in the Danish alphabet that is pronounced in the same way as ‘ö’. This way, the name, like the hash function itself, contains a mix of Austrian and Danish influences. The pronunciation of Grøstl may seem challenging. If you think so, then think of the letter ‘ø’ as the ‘i’ in ""bird"".

1427,Nautilus Coin,NAUT,"Nautlius Coin is a Scrypt coin with some unusual features such as its 1% weekly block reward reduction. Transaction confirmations are fast due to the 60 second block time and the difficulty retargetting is every block based on DigiShield. The one percent premine is used in the Nautlius stabilisation fund to ensure liquidity in the market.As pointed out by the Bank of England in its Quarterly Bulletin 2014 Q3 “The Economics of Digital Currencies”, Bitcoin faces three challenges: 1) Volatility 2) Sustainability of Low Transaction Fees 3) Limitations of a Fixed Money Supply. Nautiluscoin was designed to address and eliminate the challenges faced by Bitcoin.he Nautiluscoin Stability Fund seeks to reduce volatility, while the Proof of Stake algorithm does away with the need for expensive mining equipment. Additionally, at the heart of the Proof of Stake reward calculation is an algorithmic monetary policy that adjusts money supply with demand.The Nautiluscoin economy is built on the foundation of a strong currency policy and the view that a strong economy requires a currency which preserves purchasing power. Creating a fertile environment for an economy to develop requires the continuous pursuit of stability. But the pursuit of stability is not just about reducing daily price fluctuations.For Nautiluscoin to be truly successful it must preserve and increase purchasing power. Daily price stability is important for consumers and merchants to transact, but the long run success of any currency is a function of purchasing power. If users of a currency believe that their ability to purchase goods and services in the future will be diminished then they are less likely to hold and use the currency. Therefore the most important goal for Nautiluscoin will be to maintain a strong currency with a stable and growing purchasing power.In order to accomplish its strong currency goal, Nautiluscoin will compete with economics. Traditionally central banks with a strong currency policy are charged with providing an anchor for the economy through the use of money supply targets, interest rate targets, and/or exchange rate targets. Economic history has shown that these targets require the central bank to have significant resources in order to credibly accomplish the targets. Most successful targeting policies rely on an unlimited resource which is classically the ability to print or borrow money. In the case of Nautiluscoin, the terminal money supply is fixed by the software code and there are not public debt markets to use as an interest rate targets. However, this does not mean it lacks arrows in the quiver.Because the terminal money supply is fixed and released over time we have the ability to set the growth rate of the money supply. As well, the Nautiluscoin network will be secured through proof-of-stake method which will pay interest to those who desire to hold Nautiluscoin. Finally, the mining process allows us to support the exchange rate by using mining profits to purchase Nautiluscoin.  ",16180000,Scrypt,PoS,29/05/2014,16180000.0,"BitTrex, Poloniex, Cryptsy"

A similar amount of AMPs on the more mature and larger network will allow a piece of content to reach the attention of more users on it, increasing the value of each AMP.As well, a larger user base generates more interaction and content in circulation, increasing the total amount of attention  allocated to, and available on, Synereo.As Synereo functions as a platform for new applications and markets, AMPs may eventually become a de-facto currency.Extensibility Synereo enables a new wave of distributed applications that piggyback on the social platform and its user base.  Music streaming, content distribution, distributed marketplaces, collaborative platforms, and many other applications  can all take advantage of Synereo’s fully decentralized and distributed technology and deploy systems that truly benefit both  businesses and end users while removing the need for any middleman.Synereo is open-source and very modular, designed for rich extensibility.

2026,Decred,DCR,"Decred is an open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain. At its core is a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aims to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. The project is a result of the theoretical proposals brought by proof-of-activity (PoA) and MC2 in 2013. Decred development started in April, 2014 with a single developer and expanded to include developers from btcsuite shortly thereafter.Decred is built in the spirit of open participation and we have provided below a full disclosure of the technical features of the system, wallets and mining, initial funding and distribution, project governance and development, and a group contribution timeline.Decred opted for a different funding model in an attempt to shift the risk carried by supporters to the developers of the project. Instead of asking interested parties to fund the development of the software, the developers decided to pool funds together and carry the project to completion before making it public. The consensus was that this is an ethical path given the realities of funding software development, due to the fact that the developers alone carry the risk of the project failing, whereas in the past potential users were expected to pay for coins before any code was written. We felt this was unjust.The development of Decred was funded by Company 0 and from the pockets of its developers individually. The cost of developing the project, in terms of developer pay, totals to approximately USD 250,000, which Company 0 paid to developers. An additional amount of approximately USD 165,000 has been allocated for unpaid work and individual purchases by developers. We felt that the most equitable way to handle compensation for these expenses was to perform a small premine as part of the project launch. The model is unusual in that no developer received any amount of coins for free - all coins owned by developers will either be purchased at a rate of USD 0.49 per coin from their own pockets or exchanged for work performed at the same rate.The premine consists of 8% of the total supply of 21 million coins, meaning the premine consists of 1.68 million coins. Rather than allocating the entire premine to the bring-up costs, we decided to split the premine equally between compensation for bring-up and an ""airdrop"", where we freely give an equal amount of coins to a number of airdrop participants. This means Company 0 and its developers will have put roughly USD 415,000 into the bring-up since April, 2014 and receive 4% of the total supply, 840,000 coins (at USD 0.49 per coin). The remaining 4% will be spread evenly across a list of airdrop participants as part of an effort to build the Decred network and decentralize its distribution.  Coins held by Company 0 will be used to fund its ongoing work on open-source projects, such as Decred and btcsuite.Giving away these coins in an airdrop allows us to accomplish several things at once for the project: enlarge the Decred network, further help decentralize the distribution of coins, and allow us to get coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project. Decred is fundamentally about technological progress, so the airdrop will target individuals that have made contributions to advance technology in its various forms. The maximum number of airdrop participants is capped at 5,000 individuals, so we recommend registering sooner rather than later. These coins will be given away unconditionally and there is zero expectation of Decred receiving anything from you in return for these coins.Sign up for the airdrop is currently open, but the airdrop registration will commence on January 4th, 2016. People who have been selected to participate in the airdrop will receive an email that contains a link to a web registration form. This form will require airdrop participants to enter an address to which their coins can be sent. Binaries and source code will be made available so that you can generate a wallet seed and an address for your airdrop coins. Once you have entered your receiving address into the airdrop webform and submitted it, you will receive your coins on the projected launch date.",21000000,BLAKE256,PoW/PoS,08/02/2016,6633097.0,"Cryptopia, CCEX, Novaexchange, Bleutrade, Yobit, BitTrex, BitSquare, TuxExchange, Poloniex"
